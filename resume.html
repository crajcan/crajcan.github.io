<h2>development philosophy</h2>
<p>
    I like to think of myself as a designer of workflows as much as a developer of software. By
    shoftening the feedback loops we use to gather information from the system we can make entire
    classes of problems more solvable, and develop solutions more in line with the theory of the
    system's design.
