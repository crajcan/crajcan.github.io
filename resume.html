        <h3>Career Retrospective</h3>
        <p style=" display: none;">
            What I'm trying to say in this section:

            What I've had to deal with: uncertainty.

            What I've gained dealing with that: An ability to creatively problem solve by developing workflows with
            short
            feedback loops in various problem domains.

            What I hope to do/gain next: Experience and expertise building reliable and modifiable systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am experienced in developing in the presense of a large degree of uncertainty, working on
            systems
            that are highly resistent to being understood. At times I have even had to treat systems empirically to gain
            the
            necessary understanding required to make changes confidently. This experience has forced me to take great
            care
            in
            minimizing feedback loops while desigining workflows to tackle daily development tasks.
